          If you’re feeling unsure about business marketing, you’re in the right
          place.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I have spent over a decade as a digital marketer, working corporate
          and agency hours until finally taking the plunge as a solopreneur
          consultant. Marketing trends move fast—but I move faster. Paid media,
          SEO, drip campaigns, social media, automation…I know my way around a
          good strategy. It’s now my passion to share that knowledge with other
          marketers and build an enthusiastic community.

        <h2>Still Have Questions?</h2>
        <h3>How do I receive my package</h3>
        <p>
          After purchasing any one of my packages, you’ll receive an email from
          me with a link to your guide, a webinar information package, or a
          booking link to set up our first session.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Do I have to attend all webinars?</h3>
        <p>
          No, but I (and other customers) highly recommend that you do. You can
          attend whatever webinars within the upcoming schedule interest you,
          but you’ll receive the most value by attending all of them.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What if i don't learn anything new?</h3>
        <p>
          I confidently offer a full refund policy on any of my packages if you
          don’t learn something new – simply because I’ve never had to issue a
          refund! It’s almost guaranteed you’ll find any of my resources useful.
